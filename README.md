# TL2
I am writing a game.  I have been chewing on this game idea for years, and it has gone through many revisions.  
I am a web developer, so I am writing this in a method that will be cross platform.
Currently this is raw html, css, and js.  I have plans to eventually make this based on PHP.

Intent is to have Catan-style resources in hexagons.  Depending on how those are arranged in your village, different units will be in your army.  Currently I have a single type of unit generating on any intersection of 3 hexagons.  I have plans to make something for all 56 possible combinations of 3 (yes, `wood wood wood` is one of the combinations.  No, `wood stone wood` is not different from `stone wood wood`.)

pasture - normal units
wood - bows and spears and things
tar - any fire
hemp - any rope (Catapults!)
stone - hard/big things
iron - advanced weapons and armor
